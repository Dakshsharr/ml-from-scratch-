# Decision trees
I implemented decision trees from scracth using python and numpy.
The goal of this implementation is to understand and learn.

# Features Implemented

- Numeric feature threshold-based splits
- Supports multiple impurity measures:
  - Entropy
  - Gini Index
  - Misclassification Error
- Recursive tree construction
- Stopping conditions:
  - Maximum depth
  - Minimum samples per leaf
  - Pure node (single class)

 # Future improvements
 - Add visualization 
 - Add categorical features
