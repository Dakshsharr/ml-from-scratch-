# Linear Regression
I implemented Linear Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy.
The goal of this implementation is to understand and learn.

## Features Implemented
- Gradient Descent based optimization
- Manual loss (cost) function implementation
- Explicit bias term handling
- Supports univariate and multivariate input features
- Clean fit and predict interface

## Note
Although many libraries implement lineear regression using normal equation and i know trhats a way but to understand,learn and also do gradient descent i used this gradient descent approach.
