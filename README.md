# Machine Learning from scratch

this repository contains implementations of core machine learning algorithms built from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level libraries such as scikit-learn.

# Implemented Algorithms 
- Decision Trees(Classification)
- Linear regression(using Gradient Descent)

# Goal
to understand the algorithms on fundamental level and not rely on high level libraries.

# Techstack
- Python
- Numpy 
- Matplotlib
